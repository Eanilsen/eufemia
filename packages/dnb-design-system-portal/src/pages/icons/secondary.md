# Secondary Icons

The Secondary Icons are an addition to the [Primary Icons](/icons/primary). They extend the possibility to have more, not mainly used icons. They get not shipped integrated as the [Primary Icons](/icons/primary) do.

The Secondary Icons can be extended infinitely.

**Technically:** The consequence is that they have to be [imported](/uilib/components/icon) where ever they have to be used.
