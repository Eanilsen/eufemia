# About the Library

> Why do the **UI Library** exist?

Simply to unify the most commonly used input elements and to work together to make every of them better by times goes on.

At a first glance the Library my look complete, finished and polished. But its not. It's a living life library of font-end code we have to continuously work on and make better.

**So, please contribute, also You!**

### What I get

The Components are build with React. The reason for this is that React is very commonly used. And its more a kind of tool to make the internal state of a Component work seamlessly together with each other. But also the thinking of Components and reuse is a reason.

But to make the Components work in other environments like Vue or Angular, You could use the build-in Web Components support.

The Library is hosted on [NPM](npmjs.com), so versioning and openness is secured.

### Important parts the Library has on aim to solve

- Accessibility (ARIA Techniques, tabindex, etc.)
- Ready to use core styles
- Font usage
- Brand Color definitions

###### Components

The Unser Interface Library comes with two different parts. The first and most common are the [Components](/uilib/components/).

###### Patterns

But then there are a lot of use cases where _components_ gets combined and a kind of new component comes to life. This will then be a pattern. The best pattern setup would be more a guidance, so a Developer can the a patterns as a good startd, and go from there.
Check out the [available Patterns](/uilib/patterns/).
