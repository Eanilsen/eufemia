# Properties

> What if a property has to change at runtime?

Changing a property (`props`) at runtime is a common thing in React. But also `dnb-ui-lib` Web Components are supporting `prop` changes.
Keep in mind that not all components are barely tested to their last detail.
So if You come over some special use cases, please contribute back and make a pull request.

<dnb-web-component>
<dnb-input value="Hello"></dnb-input>

</dnb-web-component>

<script type="application/javascript">

console.log('Hello')

</script>

```jsx
```
