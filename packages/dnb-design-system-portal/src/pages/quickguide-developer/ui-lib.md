# UI Library

> Why do the **UI Library** exist?

Simply to unify the most commonly used input elements and to work together to make every of them better by times goes on.

At a first glance the Library my look complete, finished and polished. But its not. It's a living life library of font-end code we have to continuously work on and make better.

**So, please contribute, also You!**
