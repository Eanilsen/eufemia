# Icons

At DNB we are currently using Streamline icons as our source for off-the-shelf vector icons.

Link: https://www.streamlineicons.com/

## Using Icons

#### Sizing

Eufemia icons come in <b>two</b> sizes:

- 16px
- 24px

NB! @Jens & @Sindre - we probably don't need to mention the stroke weight issue....just leave it as is

#### Spacing

Icons should have a minimum area of 8px between them and their nearest neighbour.

#### Custom Icons

Streamline caters for pretty much all of Eufemia's icon needs. However, sometimes there is a need for a custom icon. In these cases please contact one of Eufemia's design leads.
