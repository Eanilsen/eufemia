# Getting Started

There are several ways to get started depending on what you want to do.

Do you want to...

- simply use the HTML Elements right away?
- customize the core DNB brand style and behavior?
- create a new global theme?
- make changes to the overall `ui-lib`?
- change texts and content of the Eufemia Design System Portal (website)?

## So, how do I get started?

You can follow a [**Quick Intro**](/uilib/intro), guiding You through all the elementary elements of Eufemia. Or continue reading all the articles in [the usage section](/uilib/usage/).

<div align="center" className="dnb-section dnb-section--spacing dnb-section--mint-green">
  <Button href="/uilib/intro" size="large" text="Quick Intro" />
</div>

## Demo App

The purpose of having Eufemia Demos is that You as a developer can see the code and understand Eufemia and be inspired - and not least, give You a good start.

<div align="center" className="dnb-section dnb-section--spacing-small dnb-section--small dnb-section--divider">
  <Button href="/uilib/demos" target="_blank" text="View Demo" variant="secondary" />
  {' '}
  <Button href="https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia-demo" target="_blank" text="Demo App at GitHub" variant="secondary" icon={GithubLogo} />
</div>
