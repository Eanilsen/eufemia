# Screen reader

In many ways, You have to kind of rethink both navigation and content presentation to make sure people with screen readers can navigate and read the application content properly.

To avoid much work afterwards, make sure You actually check You application with a screen readers **regularly during development**.

Also, screen readers **behave differently** on mobile phones than desktop browsers. So, use both in Your frontend tooling.
