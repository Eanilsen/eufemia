# Properties

> What if a property has to change at runtime?

Changing a property (`props`) at runtime is a common thing in React. But also `dnb-ui-lib` Web Components are supporting `prop` changes.
Keep in mind that not all components are barely tested to their last detail.
So if You come over some special use cases, please contribute back and make a pull request.
