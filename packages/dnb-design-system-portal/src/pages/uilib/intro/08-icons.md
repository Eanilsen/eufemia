# Icons

Icons are categories on two [main groups](!/icons) and comes in two sizes each:

- [Primary Icons](!/icons/primary)
- [Secondary Icons](!/icons/secondary)

Primary Icons are used inside of other custom [Components](!/uilib/components) and are imported by default.

It is recommended to use the [Icon Component](!/uilib/components/icon) to display icons for best accessibility.
