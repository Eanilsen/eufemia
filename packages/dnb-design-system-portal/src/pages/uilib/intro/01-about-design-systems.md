# Eufemia Design System

What is a Design System good for?

- Consistent User Experience for all DNB products
- Single source of truth
- [Contribution](!/uilib/development) and collaboration
- Independent "visual" layer with own versioning
- Notification of [new releases](!/uilib/usage#the-eufemia-repository)
- Ready to use sub systems, tested and easy to integrate
