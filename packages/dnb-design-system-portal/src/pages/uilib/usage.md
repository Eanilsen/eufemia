# Usage

#### Get started with DNB User Interface Library

The UI Lib components are isolated, ready to use components. They are self-supporting, and will use the styles they need to display. They don't rely on any global style-sheets such as normalize.css beside the main DNB Stylesheet.

You can use any of the components as demonstrated in the documentation. Please refer to each component's demo page to see how they should be imported and what parameters/props they support.

## Installation

To install and save the `dnb-ui-lib` in your package.json dependencies, run:
Please note that [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) are needed as well.

```bash
# at time of writing, React version 16 was used
# so consider to run react@16 and react-dom@16
$ yarn add dnb-ui-lib react react-dom
```
