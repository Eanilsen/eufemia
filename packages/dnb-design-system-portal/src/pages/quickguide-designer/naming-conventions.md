### Naming space

### Naming Colors

Eufemia FTW uses a simple hypenated naming structure - no camelCase. Android and iOS use camelCse, dots and underscores

Colors have a naming convention across all platforms and formats. Please refer to the table in 'colors' section (link).

We don't have a naming convention for design files in Figma. However, it is encouraged to name your design file frames and interface designs with clear logical names in english.
