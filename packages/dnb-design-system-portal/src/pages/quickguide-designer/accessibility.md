# Accessibility, Inclusivness and WCAG

#### Principles

Accessibility affects all users, not just those with stereotypical disabilities.

## WCAG (Web Content and Accessibility Guide)

The four main tenets of the WCAG 2.0 are:

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

#### Perceivable

Perceivable content must be readable.

Make sure there is enough contrast between background and text colours.

Larger text is generally more readable. Make sure text can easily be resized.

Images should have alt text.

For video, provide transcripts and captions for visual-heavy videos.

##### Do's / Don'ts

Don't use font sizes below 14px (0.875 em).

Avoid fixed pixel sizes - use relative sizing.

Never put important text as part of an image.

#### Operable

All users should be able to get to all the pages and forms.

Users should be able to interact with what they need to:

- Links
- forms
- buttons
- all other navigating and information retrieval

Keyboard navigation
