# UI inspiration

In order to see how individual elements and components fit together in a typical application, here are some partial and full examples to view for inspiration regarding spacing and composition.

Be aware that the default text styling in Eufemia does not include top and bottom margins or paddings as we see in the alternating form sections below. These spacings must be designed by the designer using the spatial system and incorporated into the design by the developer.

The first image below shows how the final form looks. The second image highlights some of the vertical spacing in the design.
