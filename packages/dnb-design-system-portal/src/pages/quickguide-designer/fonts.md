# Fonts

<!--

**NB!**
The DNB Brandbook states that the main DNB font is **Fedra Sans Alt Pro**.

Web and mobile applications use **Fedra Sans Standard**. You can [download](/assets/fonts/DNBFedraSans.zip) and use the web fonts as long as the font are shown under the DNB main domain (`dnb.no`) or sub domains.

The Source of Truth for the Downloadable fonts are located in the [repository](https://github.com/dnbexperience/eufemia/tree/develop/packages/dnb-ui-lib/src/assets/fonts): `dnb-design-system/packages/dnb-ui-lib/src/assets/fonts/`. Changes to the content of this folder will be included during a portal build process like `yarn build`.
