# Maintainability

The hard part of a living design system, like Eufemia, is not to create black holes and choosing ways to make maintainability hard and complex.

To make this more understandable, we want to create a detailed explanation about the hard part of DNB UX vision of maintaining future changes to accessibility, includness in design, diversity of thinking, future component updates and fixes, alongside with brand changes.
