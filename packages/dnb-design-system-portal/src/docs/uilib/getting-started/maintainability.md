# Maintainability

The hard part of a living design system, like Eufemia, is not to create black holes and choosing ways to make maintainability hard and complex.

To make this more understandable, we want to create a detailed explanation about the hard part of DNB UX's vision of maintaining future changes to accessibility, includness in design, diversity of thinking, future user experience evolution, alongside with brand changes.

## What is a living design system

As all these design principles will change over time, Eufemia has to be conformable.
Many developers think of a design system as a pattern library. During development, it may also look like such one-way consumption. But it is important to remember that Eufemia is about taking and giving. The giving part could be contribution or feedback about how to make integration better.

## Single source of truth

A design system has also to act as a root source, the original parts you as a developer will use and implement. And the most often used parts, Eufemia will include as the core foundation for future evolution. We call these for patterns and components.

## Integration

Now that we got a picture about what Eufemia aims to be, we will dive into more technical aspects on how to find solutions to support the system as it should be.

> It is vital that the integrations are made as easy as possible to maintain, update and be prepared for maintainability and future changes.
