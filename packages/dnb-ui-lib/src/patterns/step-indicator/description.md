The breadcrumb component is a pagination component - not a navigation.
In this example we've sent the component an array of objects to simulate a scenario in a web application.
Previously visited pages will be clickable `anchor links` and unvisited/unlocked items are simply unclickable `spans`.
`activeItem` is the active indicator.
