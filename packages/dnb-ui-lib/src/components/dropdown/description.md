## Description

The dropdown component is 100% custom-made.
The reason for this is so we can display more information in each option. Since it looks totally different on smaller screens and touch devices, doing this component 100% custom gives us more flexibility.

### When to use it

When you need to provide a considerable amount of option to the user and do not have the space to do so. Other reasons may be because the hidden options may clutter the interface and need only be displayed after the user specifically requests it.

### When not to use it

Don't use this if you have only a few 'menu' options which could otherwise be shown such as tabs or buttons.

#### NB!

_This pattern can be constructed in a number of ways to achieve a similar effect - from using the HTML 'select' element to custom building with divs, spans and javascript._
