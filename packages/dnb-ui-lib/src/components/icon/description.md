## Description

The main icon component is basically a wrapper for what ever icon you place within it. This means a `span` wrapping an inline `svg`.

There is also the [Primary Icon](/uilib/components/icon-primary/) which comes with all the [Primary Icons](/icons/primary) included.

### Icon Sizes

_Exists in the [Icon Library](/icons)_

- **default** `1rem` (16px)
- **medium** `1.5rem` (24px)

_Additional Sizes_

- **small** `0.75rem` (12px)
- **large** `2rem` (32px)

### More details

To make it clear that all the "most common" icons are loaded at once, we have an additional icon component, named `IconPrimary` or `dnb-icon-primary`.
