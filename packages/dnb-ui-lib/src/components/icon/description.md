## Description

The main icon component is basically a wrapper for whatever icon you place within it. This means a `span` wrapping an inline `svg`.

You can basically use whatever you like inside this `Icon` component.

There is also the [IconPrimary](/uilib/components/icon-primary/) component, which comes with all the [Primary Icons](/icons/primary) included in the `dnb-ui-lib`.
