## Description

The main icon component is basically a wrapper for what ever icon you place within it. This means a `span` wrapping an inline `svg`.

You can use basically what ever inside this `Icon` component.

But there is also the [IconPrimary](/uilib/components/icon-primary/) component, which comes with all the [Primary Icons](/icons/primary) included in the `dnb-ui-lib`.
