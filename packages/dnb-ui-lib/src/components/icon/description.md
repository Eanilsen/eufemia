#### Description

The main Icon component is basically only a wrapper for what ever Icon You send into it. This means a `span` wrapping an inline `svg`.

There is also the [Primary Icon](/uilib/components/icon-primary/) witch comes with all the [Primary Icons](/icons/primary) included.

### More details

To make it clear that all the "often used" icons are loaded at once, we have an additional Icon component, named `IconPrimary` or `dnb-icon-primary`.
