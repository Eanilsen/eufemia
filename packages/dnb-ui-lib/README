# DNB UI Library

The DNB UI Library has three main functions:

- It's a place to showcase DNB's latest UI components and how they are built
- With displaying the code behind each component the UI Library will be the go-to place for any developer in DNB to grab the code for the component.
- If the component doesn't exist in the UI Library it should be easy to add a new component to it.
