# DNB Design System - Packages

In here we have several packages with different purposes. `dnb-ui-lib` is the package to build the NPM version of the ui components. `dnb-design-system-portal` is the main web site to show off both the **Design System Principles and rules** and the **dnb-ui-lib** components and patterns with demo examples and code/markup.
Also included are small `examples` projects to run the components in different frameworks.
