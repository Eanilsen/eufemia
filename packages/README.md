# DNB Design System - Packages

In here we have several packages with different purposes. `dnb-ui-lib` is the package to build the NPM version of the ui components. `dnb-style-guide` is the main web site to show off both the **style guide** and the **dnb-ui-lib** component demo examples and code/markup.
But there are also small `examples` projects to run the components in different frameworks.
